# WHO'S THE REAL DEAL™?

Since Carlos was unanimously awarded the REAL DEAL™ award after winning his first 1000 in Miami on April 2022, his defeat against Korda in Montecarlo means that the American became the new REAL DEAL™. But who's holding the crown now?.

The answer is: ***Stefanos Tsitsipas***
